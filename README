DJabberd-Authen-DBIC

This is a DBIC Authen driver for DJabberd (http://www.danga.com/djabberd/).

Since DJabberD is still very much in development and as of this writting not released to 
CPAN I can not guarantee it will work with future versions. I will try to mantain it as 
best as I can and respond to feature requests, but don't be surprised if I just forget
about this module. I am on the DJabberd list and read it pretty regularly so that may
be a good way of getting your questions answered. 

This module assumes you are familiar with both DBIC and DJabberd as well as their more 
advanced options. Have Fun!
